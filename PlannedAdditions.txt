What still needs to be done:

*Recruit*
- The system can now check to see if cards can be turned in! But, it needs to know
when to turn in those cards, and how to choose which cards to discard, a.k.a. return
back to a state of null (no one owns them anymore). Also, the system doesn't distribute cards
at any point yet, so that needs to be done.
	- Define methods to distribute cards randomly.
	- Define methods to choose cards to discard EFFICIENTLY.
	- Define discriminators which determine whether a user wishes to turn in a set of cards.
- Once all the methods and discriminators for the recruit phase are defined, these need to be
implemented into the main method "recruit-phase".

*Attack*
- Everything.

*Fortify*
- Everything.

*General*
- The slider doesn't really work all too well.. Maybe we should consider a more static GUI?
Something that doesn't have to be quite so dynamic?
