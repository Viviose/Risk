BUILD IS INCOMPLETE, AS IT IS CURRENTLY IN DEVELOPMENT

Version 0.1.9 (6/5/15)
- Cleaned up spacing on ellipse function
- Updated backups
- Completed test cases and check-expects for ellipse function
- Continued work on tooltip systems
- Cleaned up spare whitespace on graph.rkt and riskFunctions.rkt
- Added territory struct

Version 0.1.8.4 (6/4/15)
- Added in comments to establish how the debug variable works
- Created testfiles folder for files containing function tests
- Completed a list of territories for reference in-game, known as variable TERRITORY-LIST
- Fixed bugs in ellipse function, MARKED for spacing polishes

Version 0.1.8.3 (6/3/15)
- in-ellipse? has been completely reworked using a triple coordinate-pair input system. Works for some test cases, but not all
- Added a debug variable to simplify enabling debug code

Version 0.1.8.2 (6/2/15)
- in-ellipse? now has all code written, test suite is under construction
- Removed redundant angle argument from in-ellipse?, since the existing vars suffice to find the angle with helper functions
- Polished code for other math functions

Version 0.1.8.1 (6/2/15)
- Created function to determine angle of a right triangle angle
- Continued ellipse-distance and changed it into boolean-returning in-ellipse?

Version 0.1.8 (5/27/15)
- Added more countries to tooltip functions
- Started working on ellipse-distance function to detect whether the mouse is inside of an ellipse
- Made progress on completing card GUI

Version 0.1.7 (5/26/15)
- Added in cards GUI
- Added in card GUI functionality to display cards
- Added in card GUI functionality to exit card GUI

Version 0.1.6 (5/20/15)
- Added in more dice functions to finalize the role of dice in the game. This should be the last update necessary besides efficiency updates.
- Added latest provisions of dice-funct.rkt to header, and commented in provisions in riskFunctions.rkt
- Added GUI element that displays turn stage
- Added in dice functions to make functions compatable with animations functions in riskFunctions.rkt, utilizing die-struct and lists of such structs

Version 0.1.5.2 (5/17/15)
- Added in comments to show provisions of all sub-modules and libraries in header of riskFunctions.rkt
- Updated readme to include latest changes

Version 0.1.5.1 (5/16/15)
- Moved dice struct to dice-functs.rkt, and renamed the struct with id of "die".
- Changed provisions of dice-functs.rkt to only provide dice functions and die struct, omitting check-expects for faster operations.
- Added in comments to show provisions of dice-functs.rkt to coders for efficient reference.
- Abstracted some dice functions for added versatility and good programming ethics.

Version 0.1.5 (5/15/15)
- Added tool-tip compatibility to more territories
- Added in a method for constructing a die with a value of 1-6, compared to previous methods only creating die of values 1-5
- Added in structure for dynamic tool-tip system
- Made source code more coder-friendly with additional comments and some improvements to spacing and indentation

Version 0.1.4.1 (5/14/15)
- Added transparent instance call in "dice" struct to improve background work
- Changed all global variable instances from lower-case to upper-case in riskFunctions.rkt to make source code more coder-friendly.
- Moved all mathematical functions used for animation purposes (i.e. Mouse-Coordinate:Coordinate comparison, changes in mouse-speed, etc.) to a new
  source file, graph.rkt

Version 0.1.4 (5/13/15)
- Added tool-tip foundation and completed tool-tip for Alaska territory
- Added territory-selected parameter to "system" struct for smoother background operations
- Fixed up dice creation images
- Completed dice functions for gameplay

Version 0.1.3 (5/12/15)
- Created basic dice functions for use in-game
- HUD and Tool-bar have now been introduced and are being debugged
- Rescaled images
- Removed spoopy ghosts

Version 0.1.2 (5/11/15)
- Created Title Screen and enabled Player Selection
- Fixed window size bugs
- Added Game Board source image to Draw handler
- "system" struct/model now incorporates list-of "player" struct

Version 0.1.1 (5/5/15)
- Established "src" and "img" libraries to optimize project efficiency and prevent corruption errors
- Defined structs for early gameplay
- Initialized Draw and Mouse handlers for early gameplay
