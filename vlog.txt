- Moved dice struct to dice-functs.rkt, and renamed the struct with id of "die".
- Changed provisions of dice-functs.rkt to only provide dice functions and die struct, omitting check-expects for faster operations.
- Added in comments to show provisions of dice-functs.rkt to coders for efficient reference.
- Abstracted some dice functions for added versatility and good programming ethics.

Version 0.1.5 (5/15/15)
- Added tooltip compatablility to more territories
- Added in a method for constructing a die with a value of 1-6, compared to previous methods only creating die of values 1-5
- Added in structure for dynamic tooltip system
- Made source code more coder-friendly with additional comments and some improvements to spacing and indentation

Version 0.1.4.1 (5/14/15)
- Added transparent instance call in "dice" struct to improve background work
- Changed all global variable instances from lower-case to upper-case in riskFunctions.rkt to make source code more coder-friendly.
